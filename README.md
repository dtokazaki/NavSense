# NavSense-Computer-Vision-for-the-Visually-Impaired
Navigating while visually impaired is extremely difficult. Without sight, people must rely on their other senses to navigate through life, mainly by way of hearing and touching (with their cane). Nonetheless, these senses can not completely make up for the loss of vision. In this paper, we propose NavSense, an assistive device that supplements existing technology, and improves navigation in day to day life. NavSense provides near real-time object identification and context to the user through auditory feedback. This paper describes the testing procedures used and results gathered while identifying the best components for the system. NavSense is capable of providing accurate results quickly on low cost and energy efficient edge devices.
